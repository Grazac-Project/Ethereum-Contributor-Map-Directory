## Overview:

This project aims to build a visual, searchable, and open-source directory of Ethereum contributors, projects, and ecosystem organizations. It will provide a central hub to discover:

- Developers, researchers, and builders actively contributing to Ethereum

- Open-source repositories and teams (e.g., L2s, DAOs, wallets, tooling)

- Contribution activity (commits, issues, PRs, community forums)

- Learning and collaboration opportunities (internships, grants, mentorship)


## Project Objectives:

- Improve Discoverability – Make it easier for newcomers, interns, and other teams to identify active contributors and projects.

- Highlight Decentralized Collaboration – Showcase the diverse range of global contributors working on Ethereum.

- Facilitate Networking and Learning – Allow users to find mentors, join projects, or follow contributors of interest.

- Provide Insightful Data – Offer a snapshot of how the ecosystem is evolving through contribution heatmaps and trends.
